# CarWasherApp-Queue-DS

## Description
an application for a self-service automatic car washer to issue tokens. Washer can handle 5 vehicles at a time. This is a good example for the students who are looking to get a understanding of how the Queue data structures are working.

## Application Logic
The tokes will be given first come first basis. When a customer comes, he /she should enter the name to the system and press proceed, and the system would issue a Token number. When it reaches the maximum limit, it should give a message “Opps we are bit busy, please wait”.

Once a customer leaves, he or she must click “Completed” on the system. Then system should take the next one in the queue an. If there are no customers, it should be display “Welcome to Automatic Car Washer”.
